    - 02 now uses Claude and TTP examples
    - 03, depending on the model can answer even though for demonstration purposes we want the model to say it is unsure. Sticking to Titan Large for this, for now.
    - 04 changed readme to encourage customers to try TTP.

### 2/15/2024

- new 'basic' set up and testing which removes the need for bedrock utils folder. All notebooks now just use default boto3 bedrock/bedrock-runtime
- Some notebooks have moved as is, and others have been merged. Making sure instructions in the notebook are still correct (markdown sections) is important
- Open source examples (Langchain, Nemo)  have been moved to a separate folder. Some existing PRs can be fixed and tested directly here. Once we test it we can resolve those PRs and point to the new release.
- Fine tuning and other new feature examples are needed
